ChangeLog for 2.53.0 

//Gamma 5

Updated all default active subscreens in qst.dat, with the new items. 
Added the following item scripts to Classic.zh, and items
	to the default quest in qst.dat:
	
	MagicBossKey: Acts like the Magical Key, for Boss Locks.
		Set to item ID: 146
	MagicalMap: Gives the player the dungeon map to every dungeon.
		Set to item ID: 147
	Magical Compass: Gives the player the compass item to every dungeon.
		Set to item ID: 148

Renamed all system-wide screenshot files as follows:
	ZC: 
		zc_screen#####.png
	ZQuest:
		Maps:
			zq_map#####.png
		Screen:
			zq_screen#####.png
	( ZoriaRPG, 6th March, 2019 )

The Export ZScript now uses the .zs extension by default (no ZLIB conflicts).
ZCL version is now 2.6.12:
	Fixed default pane of the ZQuest tab in ZCL.
	Removed duplicate 'Misaligns' option box in ZCL.
Cleaned all intermediates, all project files, and all CMake files.
	Built clean.
Changed l_down sprites on 8-way enemy shots to face down.
	( ZoriaRPG, 5th March, 2019 )

//Gamma 4
Classic.zh: Fix BossExplode ffc to work with all segmented bosses. 

Resize fields for text entry to fit five chars. 
Fixed Init Data (and cheat data) field sizes for:
	Heart Containers (was a field size of 2, now 3)
	Starting HP (in hearts, was 3 now size 5)
	Starting Magic (was size 3, now 5)
	Max Magic (was size 3, now 5)
	Super Bomb Ratio (was size 2, now 3)

Updated qst.dat 

Fixed the SignPost ffc script.

Moved the new functions from Classic.zh to std_functions.zh.
Added some relativity functions to Classic.zh--should move to std_functions.zh:
	DistXY(ffc, int), LeftOf(), RightOf(), Above(), Below(), Facing(ffc).

2.50.x quests with a build < 31, or quests with a header 
	version < 0x250 will now write hitsfx = WAV_EHIT, for all guys where 
	the hitsfx sound == 0, on saving a quest in 2.53.

Quests made in 2.53 Gamma 0/1 or earlier (build 31) now load
	WAV_EHIT into the enemy editor hitsfx field when the editor opens.
	This prevents corruption of the quest by modifying the value on quest load,
	and ensures that the value only changes if the user saves the quest in 2.53.

2.50.2 AND EARLIER play SFX_HIT even if Enemy Editor Hit Sound is 0. 
	Thus, I added a special case that causes this to happen in guys.cpp, based
	on header version and build. 

	Arbitrary enemy policy 15610. :P
	( ZoriaRPG, 25th February, 2019 )

Fixed Byrna Cleanup Routine killing SFX 30. This was caused by
	`last_cane_of_byrna_item_id` never being able to be -1 because it was declared
	as byte, instead of int.

Classic.zh Fixes and Improvements:
	Renamed constants to prevent future conflicts.
	BossMusic ffc: 
		Fixed a bug that caused the victory music to re-play when the
		player revisited the screen.
		Added InitD variables to allow customisation by the user.
	BossExplode ffc:
		Added InitD variables to allow customisation by the user.
	DropTRIFORCE ffc:
	DropHEARTCONTAINER ffc:
		Fixed a bug that caused the TF drop to repeat if the player revisited
		the screen.
		Added a dropshadow to the object when falling.
		Slowed falling descent. 
		Clamped screen coordinates of drop to ensure that the object does
		not fall partway off the edges of the screen.
	( ZoriaRPG, 24th February, 2019 )


Added scripts 'DropTRIFORCE' and 'DropHEARTCONTAINER' to Classic.zh.
	Fixed issue where invalid weapons were loaded by 'BossMusic' ffc script
	because of a Waitframe in the loop.
	Removed traces.

Added a case for r_down dir on 8-way EW_MAGIC shots. 
	( ZoriaRPG, 22nd February, 2019 )

	Updated all active subscreens to include the new items.

Commented out some conflicting constants in stdExtra.zh
Moved stdWeapons and Laser.zh into an 'extras' path.
Corrected power rating of remote bombs. 
	This will only affect quests saved in 2.53, and 
	only if the power of the bomb is > 1. 
Reverted back to Gleeok's forced on bit for half tile collision 
	in quests made in 2.50.0 and 2.50.1 Or lower 2.50 builds).
Expanded the Emulation menu toggle to cover builds through 2.50.1. 
	I'm tired of this one, too. 
Began adding some default scripts to Classic (as Classic.zh), and 
	corrected some constants in the included scripts, to match.
Fixed the selection mark for Bombchu Emulation, and ensured that
	it is enabled by default for 2.50.0 and 2.50.1 quests.

	( ZoriaRPG, 18th February, 2019 )

//Gamma 3
Updated qst.dat, to strip out some remaining rubbish pal cycle data. 
Fixes for Palette Cycle Issues:
	Palettes above 256 were not set up to have palette cycles in 2.50.
	The array in QMisc is [256][3], where it should have been [512][3].

	Because of this, palettes above 0xFF had rubbish data associated to their cycle data.

	To remedy this, I have done the following:

		All palettes > 255 have a null palette loaded into them, in the editor and as
		palette data, to zero out their cycle information.

		This should occur both in ZC, and in ZQuest.

		I disabled clicking the Cycle button in the Level palette editor, and display
		a jwin-alert that the palette doesn't support cycling.

	Let's hope this doesn't cause crashes in any quests, in ZC.


Added leading zeros to the 'Select Item' 'Pow: ' field, so that
items with powers greater than 10 don't carry over digits to items with
powers < 10.
	( ZoriaRPG, 17th February, 2019 )
Re-fix 1st.qst Level 9 Rupee issue. I had set the wrong type. 
	( NightmareJames, 16th February, 2019 )
Updated include 'tango.zh', and its associated demo to current versions of both.
Pressing the Enter key, or the numpad Enter key, while viewing
the Quest Header dialogue now EITHER activates the selected element, 
	or saves the dialogue changes, instead of opening the
	'Change Quest password' sub-dialogue. 
	It will auto-save if the selected element is OK, or any TEXT field.
	Otherwise, it triggers the selected element.
	This should also work from the numpad Enter key. 
	I also made the changes as an EXAMPLE chain, for making all
	JWin DIALOGUES more user-friendly, in the future.

Added a new function, Link.cleanupByrna() and called it in game_loop() (zelda.cpp).
Added a sfx cleanup for the byrna beam to weapons.cpp.
Added a new LinkClass variable, byte last_cane_of_byrna, that functions similar to
	last_lens_id.
	It inits at -1, then when Link uses a cane, it is set to that cane's ID.
	It is reset to -1 in Link.cleanupByrna().
Added kill_sfx() call to three other possible places where the Cane of Byyrna
	sound should probably be terminated:
	Whenever we call stopCaneOfByrna()
	If we can't pay the cost during item / weapon init
	If the beams aren't created during init, for some reason. 
Re-adjust qr_OFFSETEWPNCOLLISIONFIX in qst.cpp, to force it on for 2.50.0 build < 24, 
	instead of build |< 29 (as Gleeok forced it). 

	I tested SIX quest files, CREATED in three versions of ZQuest:
		2.50.0, bit set off (b24)
		2.50.0, bit set on (b24)
		2.50.1, bit set off (b28)
		2.50.1, bit set on (b28)
		2.50.2, bit set off (b29)
		2.50.2, bit set on (b29)
	If we check build < 29, then quests made in 2.50.0 and possibly 2.50.1 have
	the bit forced on, when it wasn't intended.
    
	Unless the actual BEHAVIOUR of this bit has changed (this needs verification), 
	then builds 24, 28, 29, 30, 31, and 32 should never force this bit on. 
	
	It is certainly possible that quests made prior to build 24 (2.50.0 release) have this wrong.
	I would need to check every RC to see, and backtrack from there. 
	( ZoriaRPG, 16th February, 2019 )
	
Fixed a secret rupee in Lv9 (1st.qst) not being secret.
	( NightmareJames, 31st January, 2019; file added to Gamma 3, 14th February, 2019 )
Reverted the patch that stopped Ganon from hurting Link if Link
	is standing on Ganon when Ganon dies. 
	We can apply this as a general rule or fix to all enemy behaviour in 2.55.

	The NES Ganon hurts Link. 

Cleared Link's attackclk before calling saved_Zelda(). 
	This prevents a charged sword, or other weapon, from carrying
	over to the ending sequence as a visual artefact. 
Stop playing byrna beam sfx as soon as the beams die in Link.cpp
Fix stunned peahats hurting Link in 2.50+ quests.
	( ZoriaRPG, 14th February, 2019 )

//Gamma 2
Changed the default length of the short hookshot to 8. 
	At one point, the distance was in pixels, then someone
	changed it to tiles. We'll make pixels an option again in 2.55. 
Reverted the usesound value for the Magic Book in qst.dat.
Reverted the last two changes, and hardcoded WAV_FIRE in weapons.cpp.
Hardcoded wand fire sfx for quests made in builds prior to 2.53 Gamma 2 (2.50 Build 32)
Increased Build ID to 32, and updated qst.dat (again).
	( ZoriaRPG, 13th February, 2019 )
Fixed default sound for magic book on quest load for older quests, and
	set to 13 (WAV_FIRE) in qst.dat for default blank quest.
	(Updated qst.dat)
Corrected copyright year in zdefs.h. 
Fixed the following in std.zh:
	Added revised behaviour to RotatePointX() and RotatePointY().
	Added toggle for old/new RotatePointX() and RotatePointY() behaviour.
	Probably fixed issues with catsizes() in ScreenFlag() and ScreenEFlag().
	Swap lit bomb and bomb returns in int WeaponTypeToID(int wpnt).
	Remove extraneous 's' in bool EnemiesAlive().
	Add float LargeDistance(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2, int divisor).

	Somehow the file size on disc decreased in the process. Not sure on this one.
Possibly fix some issues with the hammer.
Fixed screenshots saving without using modifier keys.
	This had nothing to do with the cheat system, but rather, was an invalid sprintf
	format in onNonGUISnapshot.
Emulation: Restrict Repeating DMap Intros to 2.11.x
Enabling or disabling the Debig Console (win32 only) now updates and saves
	the zc.cfg file setting for debug_console under zeldadx.
Fixed Link->Misc being multiplied and divided by 10000. 
	( ZoriaRPG, 12th February, 2019 )

Fixed Wealth Medals in Bomb/Arrow upgrade rooms which use percentage zero 
	out cost (integer division != double division) (guys.cpp)
	No code was ever in place to give the discount? (link.cpp)
	( Venrob, 11th February, 2019 )

	greater than 999. Required refactor.

	The main in-focus page is once again ZC.

//Beta 36
Fix 'OK' button in joystick button config not saving.
Fix screenshot numbering format to have a width of 5, not 3.
	( ZoriaRPG, 28th January, 2019 )
Added an Emulation toggle to try to permit continuous sword triggers
	in 2.10 and 2.50 quests.
	I'm not sure what the latest 2.50 build is, that should permit this, but if LI
	was saved in a later build, and needs it, then here it is.
Try to fix tall grash animation during scrolling.
Try to fix Ganon's Ashes not spawning.
	( ZoriaRPG, 25th January, 2019 )
	
Possible fix for the following reported issue:

	prevent them from appearing int he wrong spot if the player changes direction abruptly.
	( ZoriaRPG, 24th January, 2019 )

	( ZoriaRPG, 14th January, 2019 )

//Beta 31
Added an Emulation Menu option to enable drop-per-segment
	for Lanmola, Manhandla, and Moldorm. 
	This needs testing in older quests, and further verification.

	should work in 2.50+ quests.
	( ZoriaRPG, 8th January, 2019 )
	
//Beta 30

//Beta 26
Probably fixed issues that Avataro reported with Vire enemies.
	( ZoriaRPG, 3rd December, 2018 )
