--To Set Up DXGL for ZC--

1. Run the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Installer 
(vcredist_x86.exe) and install the required support files. 
	You may skip this step if you already have this
	installed on your system.
2. Move the contents of ./Addons/dxgl into the same path
as zelda.exe and zquest.exe.
3. Edit dxgl.cfg if desired to change video modes. 
The modes that you can set are at the bottom. 
Simply uncomment the mode that you iwsh to use:

In this example, the last mode is running:
	; Fullscreen - change display mode
	;Include = dxgl-fullscreen.cfg

	; Fullscreen - aspect stretch
	;Include = dxgl-aspect.cfg

	; Fullscreen - Expand game to 4:3 aspect
	Include = dxgl-aspect-zc-43-scale.cfg
	
	
In this example, the middle mode is running:	
	; Fullscreen - change display mode
	;Include = dxgl-fullscreen.cfg

	; Fullscreen - aspect stretch
	Include = dxgl-aspect.cfg

	; Fullscreen - Expand game to 4:3 aspect
	;Include = dxgl-aspect-zc-43-scale.cfg
